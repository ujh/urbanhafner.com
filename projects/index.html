          Riskmethods develops a SaaS solution for supply chain risk management. The application is written in Ruby on Rails as the server side framework with big parts of the UI written in JavaScript using Backbone.js. A lot of the application logic is invisible to the user and is happening in background jobs. This includes interfacing to various third party services using a variety of APIs.

        <p>
          I am part of the development team and work on all areas of the application. This includes interfacing with third party services, building Bootstrap frontend applications as well as the internal APIs they use. I also do «<em>infrastructure</em>» work, including speeding up the test suite, or setting up continuous deployment to a staging environment.

        <p>
          The Mobility House was operating the selling and installing of the charging stations for BMW electric vehicles. The app used for this purpose uses a multi-step workflow system involving several parties (the car dealer, electrician, BMW headquarter, ...) that needs to be modeled in software. The project was based on Ruby on Rails 3.2, MySQL, Apache, and Phusion Passenger. The development was run using an agile process (1 week sprints, Kanban style board, weekly retrospectives, code reviews) with a distributed multi-national team. As the codebase was already a few years old emphasis was placed on improving the code quality through code reviews, refactorings, and tools like Code Climate.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was part of the development team as an external contractor and also automated the setup of the server infrastructure using Chef solo.

          Bonjour Bonjour is a French startup that provides a localized social
          network on portable devices. I'm working on the server side API part
          which is written in Ruby on Rails. The work includes rewriting big
          parts of the application to allow for scalability, while at the same
          time not interrupting the operation of the service.

          After writing the initial implementation in 2007, I'm now again working
          on this project. I develop (small) new features and I keep the site
          running as it should. This includes server maintenance and upgrades of
          the underlying software (Ruby, Ruby on Rails, ...) as well as bug fixes.

            A small web app for a single event. The homepage design was provided
          as a PSD file. I implemented it using Ruby on Rails, TypeKit fonts,
          and Twitter Bootstrap. The app also includes a ticket sales system with
          payments through Paypal and the app generates the personalized tickets
          as PDFs.
